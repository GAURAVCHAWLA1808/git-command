# `git pull origin main --rebase` Explained ðŸš€

This command pulls the latest changes from the remote `main` branch and applies your local commits **on top of them**. It ensures a linear commit history by **rebasing** instead of merging.

## **Breakdown of the Command**
1. **`git pull origin main`** â†’ Fetches changes from `origin/main` and merges them into your local branch.  
2. **`--rebase`** â†’ Instead of merging, it:  
   - Fetches remote changes  
   - Moves your local commits aside  
   - Applies remote commits first  
   - Reapplies your local commits on top  

## **Why Use `--rebase` Instead of Merge?**
âœ… **Keeps history clean** â†’ Avoids unnecessary merge commits.  
âœ… **Makes collaboration smoother** â†’ Ensures your changes are always on top.  
âœ… **Avoids merge conflicts** â†’ Less cluttered commit history.  

## **Example Workflow**
Imagine you and your team are working on the `main` branch. While you were making changes locally, new commits were pushed to the remote repository. Instead of merging, you want to **rebase** to maintain a clean history.

### **Scenario Before Rebase**  
Your local branch (`main`):  
```
A - B - C (your local commits)  
     \  
      D - E - F (new commits on origin/main)  
```
If you run a normal `git pull origin main`, Git will create a **merge commit**, making the history messy.

### **After Running `git pull origin main --rebase`**  
Git will:  
1. Fetch remote commits (`D - E - F`).  
2. Move your commits (`A - B - C`) aside.  
3. Apply remote commits first.  
4. Reapply your commits on top.

Resulting history:  
```
D - E - F - A - B - C (rebased commits on top)
```
Now, your commits are neatly applied **on top of the latest remote changes**.

## **What If There Are Conflicts?**
During rebase, Git may detect conflicts. If that happens:
- Git will pause and show conflict markers in the affected files.
- Fix conflicts manually, then run:  
  ```sh
  git add <conflicted-file>
  git rebase --continue
  ```
- If you want to cancel the rebase:  
  ```sh
  git rebase --abort
  ```

## **Final Step: Push the Changes**
Since rebase rewrites history, you may need to force push:  
```sh
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```
(**Safer than `-f` as it prevents overwriting others' changes.**)

## **TL;DR**
- `git pull origin main --rebase` ensures a **clean, linear history**.  
- It applies remote changes **first**, then your local commits **on top**.  
- If conflicts arise, resolve them and continue the rebase.
